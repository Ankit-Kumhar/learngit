# LearnGit
if you want to push your previously created folder into git use this command step by step:
-> git init (To initialize the folder into the git)
-> git remote add origin <link> (To set the path of the folder in the github)
-> git remote -v (To verify the path)
-> git branch (To check what is your current working branch)
-> git push origin main (To push the folder or file into the github)
-> or git push -u origin main (if you work in this folder for a long time and want to push in the main branch)
-> git push (if you do the second last step rather than third last step then you do not need to write origin main it automatically push your changes into the git hub)
